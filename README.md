### Do you like to code too?? ⌨️

I'm a software engineer (currently working on the dreaded management side of things) but enjoy spending time writing code and learning new things.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning some rust, typescript and more nixos (current daily driver, and loving it)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can be exciting!  I don't have much free time, but love to have outlined projects to work on when I end up with some freetime.
